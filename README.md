AI Image Generator | Text to Image

## Prompts
```
I want to create a fully functional prompt-to-image converter AI model using a Hugging Face token. Can you please guide me step by step on how to obtain the token from Hugging Face? I want to create the AI model using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the same block.

```
```
Token: "huggingface Access Tokens with read permissions"
This is my token key. Now, can you create a text-to-image converter using this access token with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a professional and attractive design with a menu and footer?
